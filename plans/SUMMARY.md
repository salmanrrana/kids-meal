## Development Notes

### Design Tokens Philosophy
**Always use CSS custom properties** - never hardcode values:

✅ **Good**:
```css
.card {
  padding: var(--space-3);
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
}
```

❌ **Bad**:
```css
.card {
  padding: 24px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07);
}
```

### Component Reusability
- Build components to be reusable across all pages
- Keep components simple and focused
- Pass props for flexibility (size, variant, color, etc.)
- Follow patterns in `CLAUDE.md`

### Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile styles
- Use `@media (min-width: 768px)` for larger screens
- Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools
- Prioritize touch interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load images
- Minify and optimize CSS
- Use hardware acceleration (transform, opacity)
- Avoid layout shifts with proper dimensions

### Accessibility First
- Plan for keyboard users from the start
- Test with real screen readers
- Don't rely only on color to convey information
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
